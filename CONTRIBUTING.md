# How to contribute

First of all, English isn't my mother language. I know my limitations, and I Won't have felt offended if someone corrects my English. I will feel gratitude for learning.

This project is coming from my PhD. studies, I decided to perform a log _post-mortem_ analysis for my experiments.
