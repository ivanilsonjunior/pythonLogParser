# Cooja log Parser

System for parsing experiments.
**Based on [examples/benchmarks/result-visualization](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/tree/develop/examples/benchmarks/result-visualization)**


- Runs Cooja on non-GUI mode
- Uses node.c as mote
- After the run, the log is parsed to an ORM
- Metrics could be extrated from ORM
- Lots of things TODO!!!!!


**Due to my programming skills limitation I've decided to write the "_FrontEnd_" using Jinja Templates over Flask**
